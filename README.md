# Leaf

**Leaf** is a lightweight CLI + GUI tool for editing PDF outlines (bookmarks).  
It lets you add, remove, rename, move, and group bookmarks with precision â€” all from a neat shell interface.  
The GUI exists and works, but is minimal and **not recommended yet**.  
The **CLI** is full-blown and rock-solid.
